# ADEEPT Robot V3.1 HAT – central configuration
# -------------------------------------------------
# This file serves as a convenient import location for paths to the
# component‑specific configuration files.  It is deliberately minimal;
# each subsystem (LEDs, servos, etc.) maintains its own YAML file
# with detailed parameters.

leds:
  # Path to the LED‑group configuration (relative to this file)
  config_path: "./leds/config.yaml"

servos:
  # Path to the servo‑channel configuration
  config_path: "./servos/config.yaml"
# You can extend this file with additional sections (e.g. i2c_devices,
# adc_channels) as the HAT evolves.
